_A [gravitational slingshot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_assist) makes use of the gravity and relative movements of celestial bodies to accelerate a spacecraft and change its trajectory._


# Slingshot: edge record cache

Applications in [ATProtocol](https://atproto.com/) store data in users' own [PDS](https://atproto.com/guides/self-hosting) (Personal Data Server), which are distributed across thousands of independently-run servers all over the world. Trying to access this data poses challenges for client applications:

- A PDS might be far away with long network latency
- or may be on an unreliable connection
- or overloaded when you need it, or offline, or…

Large projects like [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/) control their performance and reliability by syncing all app-relevant data from PDSs into first-party databases. But for new apps, building out this additional data infrastructure adds significant effort and complexity up front.

**Slingshot is a fast, eager, production-grade cache of data in the [ATmosphere](https://atproto.com/)**, offering performance and reliability without custom infrastructure.


### Current status

Slingshot is currently in a **v0, pre-release state**. There is one production instance and you can use it! Expect short downtimes for restarts as development progresses and lower cache hit-rates as the internal storage caches are adjusted and reset.

The core APIs will not change, since they are standard third-party `com.atproto` query APIs from ATProtocol.


## Eager caching

In many cases, Slingshot can cache the data you need *before* first request!

Slingshot subscribes to the global [Firehose](https://atproto.com/specs/sync#firehose) of data updates. It keeps a short-term rolling indexed window of *all* data, and automatically promotes content likely to be requested to its longer-term main cache. _(automatic promotion is still a work in progress)_

When there is a cache miss, Slingshot can often still accelerate record fetching, since it keeps a large cache of resolved identities: it can usually request from the correct PDS without extra lookups.


## Precise invalidation

The fireshose includes **update** and **delete** events, which Slingshot uses to ensure stale and deleted data is removed within a very short window. Additonally, identity and account-level events can trigger rapid cleanup of data for deactivated and deleted accounts. _(some of this is still a work in progress)_


## Low-trust

The "AT" in ATProtocol [stands for _Authenticated Transfer_](https://atproto.com/guides/glossary#at-protocol): all data is cryptographically signed, which makes it possible to broadcast data through third parties and trust that it's real _without_ having to directly contact the originating server.

Two core standard query APIs are supported to balance convenience and trust. They both fetch [records](https://atproto.com/guides/glossary#record):

### [`com.atproto.repo.getRecord`](#tag/comatproto-queries/get/xrpc/com.atproto.repo.getRecord)

- convenient `JSON` response format
- cannot be proven authentic

### [`com.atproto.sync.getRecord`](#tag/comatproto-queries/get/xrpc/com.atproto.sync.getRecord)

- [`DAG-CBOR`](https://atproto.com/specs/data-model)-encoded response requires extra libraries to decode, but
- includes a cryptographic proof of authenticity!

_(work on this endpoint is in progress)_


## Ergonomic APIs

- Slingshot also offers variants of the `getRecord` endpoints that accept a full `at-uri` as a parameter, to save clients from needing to parse and validate all parts of a record location.

- Bi-directionally verifying identity endpoints, so you can directly exchange atproto [`handle`](https://atproto.com/guides/glossary#handle)s for [`DID`](https://atproto.com/guides/glossary#did-decentralized-id)s without extra steps, plus a convenient [Mini-Doc](#tag/slingshot-specific-queries/get/xrpc/com.bad-example.identity.resolveMiniDoc) verified identity summary.


## Part of microcosm

[Microcosm](https://www.microcosm.blue/) is a collection of services and independent community-run infrastructure for ATProtocol.

Slingshot excels when combined with _shallow indexing_ services, which offer fast queries of global data relationships but with only references to the data records. Microcosm has a few!

- [🌌 Constellation](https://constellation.microcosm.blue/), a global backlink index (all social interactions in atproto are links!)
- [🎇 Spacedust](https://spacedust.microcosm.blue/), a firehose of all social interactions

All microcosm projects are [open source](https://tangled.sh/@bad-example.com/microcosm-links). **You can help sustain Slingshot** and all of microcosm by becoming a [Github sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/uniphil/) or a [Ko-fi supporter](https://ko-fi.com/bad_example)!
